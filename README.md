 Identifing an initial set of features in the Ames dataset 
 Develop using mutual information scores and interaction plots.
 Real-State data set, alike the real world, such as Zillo
 Features includes :
 Location: Neighborhood
Size: all of the Area and SF features, and counts like FullBath and GarageCars
Quality: all of the Qual features
Year: YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd
Types: descriptions of features and styles like Foundation and GarageType
"These are all the kinds of features you'll commonly see in real-estate listings (like on Zillow), It's good then that our mutual information metric scored them highly. On the other hand, the lowest ranked features seem to mostly represent things that are rare or exceptional in some way, and so wouldn't be relevant to the average home buyer."
